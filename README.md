## Features

- Start, stop, and reset buttons.
- Displays time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- Precise timing with intervals of 10 milliseconds.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons to control the timer.

## How It Works

- The timer uses JavaScript intervals to increment milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.
- Clicking the "Start" button triggers the `startTimer` function, which updates the display every 10 milliseconds.
- The "Stop" button clears the interval, pausing the timer.
- The "Reset" button resets all time values to zero.
